## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: 4m 31s
- Total execution time: 13m 54s

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 30 | 3 | 13m 54s | 4m 38s |

## Tech Debt (Carried Forward)

| Issue | Priority | Impact | From |
|-------|----------|--------|------|
| indicator.router.ts uses publicProcedure | High | Unprotected API access | v3.0 |
| alert.router.ts uses publicProcedure | High | Unprotected API access | v3.0 |
| position.router.ts uses publicProcedure | High | Unprotected API access | v3.0 |
| switch-mode is a stub | Medium | Mode doesn't actually switch | v4.0 |
| Autostart has no user context | High | Can't load user settings/symbols | v5.0 |
| Autostart hardcodes exchangeId=1 (Coinbase) | Medium | Autostart only supports Coinbase | v5.0 |
| Routers hardcode TEST_USER_ID/TEST_EXCHANGE_ID | Medium | Tied to publicProcedure debt | v3.0 |
| Legacy userId param in cache calls | Low | Cache API signature requires unused param | v5.0 |

## Accumulated Context

### Hard Constraints (User-Specified)

| Constraint | Reason |
|------------|--------|
| **NO cron jobs** | User explicitly rejected node-cron approach |
| **NO aggregation** | User stated "Don't suggest aggregate to me ever again" |
| **Zero 429 errors** | Core reliability requirement |
| **Atlas-only migrations** | Drizzle migrations BANNED - schema.sql is source of truth |
| **SSL required** | Azure PostgreSQL requires SSL - hardcode, don't use env vars |
| **No silent defaults** | If exchange unknown, surface error -- never default to Coinbase |

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- 30-01-D1: adminEmail/adminDisplayName nullable in InstanceStatus (user identity unavailable at registration)
- 30-01-D2: Key pattern `exchange:{id}:status` (consistent with existing exchange-scoped keys)
- 30-01-D3: Separate HEARTBEAT_TTL_SECONDS constant (Redis EX takes seconds, not ms)
- 30-02-D1: Self-restart detection uses hostname match, not full instanceId (PID/timestamp change on restart)
- 30-02-D2: setAdminInfo/setSymbolCount defer Redis write to next heartbeat (reduces round-trips)
- 30-02-D3: Register retries on NX fail + GET null race (key can expire between operations)
- 30-03-D1: Placeholder registry with exchangeId=0 for idle mode (replaced in handleStart)
- 30-03-D2: Fresh InstanceRegistryService in handleStart (immutable exchangeId)
- 30-03-D3: Migrated exchange-symbol.router to new key format (exchange:{id}:status)

### Pending Todos

## Session Continuity

### Last Session

**Date:** 2026-02-10
**Activity:** Executed 30-03-PLAN.md (Integration: Wire Services into Lifecycle, 2 tasks)
**Stopped At:** Completed 30-03-PLAN.md -- Phase 30 complete

### Resume Context

**PHASE 30 COMPLETE**

All 3 plans delivered:
- 30-01: Foundation types (ConnectionState, InstanceStatus, VALID_TRANSITIONS, instanceStatusKey, detectPublicIp)
- 30-02: Core services (StateMachineService, InstanceRegistryService)
- 30-03: Integration (wired into server.ts startup/shutdown, control-channel handleStart/handleStop, removed prototype)

All 17 requirements (REG-01 through REG-06, HB-01 through HB-04, LOCK-01 through LOCK-04, FIX-01 through FIX-03) verified complete.

Next: Phase 31 (Health Monitoring Dashboard or Network Status).
