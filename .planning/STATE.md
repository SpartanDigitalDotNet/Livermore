## Tech Debt (Carried Forward)

| Issue | Priority | Impact | From |
|-------|----------|--------|------|
| indicator.router.ts uses publicProcedure | High | Unprotected API access | v3.0 |
| alert.router.ts uses publicProcedure | High | Unprotected API access | v3.0 |
| position.router.ts uses publicProcedure | High | Unprotected API access | v3.0 |
| switch-mode is a stub | Medium | Mode doesn't actually switch | v4.0 |
| Autostart has no user context | High | Can't load user settings/symbols | v5.0 |
| Autostart hardcodes exchangeId=1 (Coinbase) | Medium | Autostart only supports Coinbase | v5.0 |
| Routers hardcode TEST_USER_ID/TEST_EXCHANGE_ID | Medium | Tied to publicProcedure debt | v3.0 |
| Legacy userId param in cache calls | Low | Cache API signature requires unused param | v5.0 |

## Accumulated Context

### Hard Constraints (User-Specified)

| Constraint | Reason |
|------------|--------|
| **NO cron jobs** | User explicitly rejected node-cron approach |
| **NO aggregation** | User stated "Don't suggest aggregate to me ever again" |
| **Zero 429 errors** | Core reliability requirement |
| **Atlas-only migrations** | Drizzle migrations BANNED - schema.sql is source of truth |
| **SSL required** | Azure PostgreSQL requires SSL - hardcode, don't use env vars |
| **No silent defaults** | If exchange unknown, surface error -- never default to Coinbase |

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- 30-01-D1: adminEmail/adminDisplayName nullable in InstanceStatus (user identity unavailable at registration)
- 30-01-D2: Key pattern `exchange:{id}:status` (consistent with existing exchange-scoped keys)
- 30-01-D3: Separate HEARTBEAT_TTL_SECONDS constant (Redis EX takes seconds, not ms)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns
